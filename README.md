Developed a C# console-based banking system implementing OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system allows users to create accounts (Regular and Savings), deposit, withdraw, check balance, and apply interest for savings accounts. Used collections for account management, implemented exception handling for input validation, and ensured modularity with well-structured methods.
